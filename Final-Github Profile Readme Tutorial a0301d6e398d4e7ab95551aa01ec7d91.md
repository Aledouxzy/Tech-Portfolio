# Final-Github Profile Readme Tutorial

## Tutorial to Create Your Github Profile Readme

Now that you have created a Github account you can create a repository with a readme that will display its contents as a cover page for your profile. This will allow you to display more character and content than the Github "bio" section, because this page can be personalized, much like a business card or a social media profile. The steps below will show you how to create this page for your personal use.

Note: This tutorial will only cover the creation of a profile readme through Github online **not** using local files and the Git command line interface.

1. Make sure you are logged into your Github account. At the top of the webpage will be a search bar and other functions.

  2. Click this button to open the dropdown menu to create a **new repository**.

  3. Click the **New Repository** option.

    4. There are three conditions that must be met for your repository's readme to be used as a profile readme. 

- The repository name must *exactly* match the account name
- It must be set to public access
- "Add a README file" option must be selected

Below is a sample image of this page with the correct options selected and profile name entered correctly.

**After checking all the options proceed to step 5.**

    5. Now simply "Create Repository" and you will be redirected to your new repository main branch. The readme can now be edited.

Congratulations! You have now created a readme file whose contents are linked to your profile page. Although not covered in this tutorial this readme supports the use of /markdown language and some <HTML> commands. Search the internet for ideas or look around Github on how to personalize your new Github Profile readme.

Once you type the repository name correctly the green prompt will appear.

You **can** set the readme to private if you wish to edit it privately, but it must be set back to public to display in your profile.
